// This constructor function creates new instances of the Article object and assigns the keys of each new instance to match the keys of the object literal (in the "rawData" array) from which it is created (see the 'for' loop in line 49)

//line 10 is what happens when the forEach loop runs, and it assigns to the new Article object created the key/value pair of the first item in the rawData array, and does this for every item in that array.
